# SecOps Research Initiative

Welcome to the public documentation and demonstration repository for security operations research conducted by [GraphSentinel](https://github.com/graphsentinel) and [Conjectura R&D](https://conjectura.net).

This site hosts whitepapers, architectural documentation, and proof-of-concept materials for our security research initiatives.

## Current Research

### SFAMDF: Secure, Federated, Adaptable Multi-Agent Defense Framework

A proactive defense architecture for securing agentic AI systems operating over the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Status**: Whitepaper in progress

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [Overview](sfamdf/) | Introduction to proactive federated defense |
| [Architecture](architecture/) | Visual architecture diagrams and component reference |
| [Reactive vs Proactive](comparison/) | Detailed comparison of defense approaches |

#### Key Concepts

- **Behavioral Detection** over pattern matching
- **Federated Intelligence** across trust boundaries
- **Governance Contracts** for predictable delegation
- **Expert-in-the-Loop** at decision points
- **Adaptive Response** to emerging patterns

## Research Areas

### Agentic AI Security

Developing security frameworks for autonomous AI systems, with focus on:

- Multi-agent coordination security
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) hardening
- Trust and delegation models
- Human oversight integration

### Graph-Based Security Analytics

Applying Graph Neural Networks to security operations:

- Threat correlation across organizational boundaries
- Anomaly detection in distributed systems
- Attack path analysis and prediction
