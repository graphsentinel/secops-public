# SFAMDF Implementation Patterns

This section provides concrete implementation patterns demonstrating SFAMDF principles in practice.

---

## Available Patterns

### OSINT Agent Pattern

A distributed OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) agent implementation demonstrating:

- Federated orchestration with Raft consensus
- AgentBox sandboxing for secure execution
- Human-in-the-loop decision workflows
- Distributed state management and failover

[View OSINT Agent Pattern](osint/)

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern includes:

1. **Architecture Overview** - High-level component diagram
2. **Data Flow** - How information moves through the system
3. **Security Controls** - Applied SFAMDF security layers
4. **Implementation Notes** - Practical deployment considerations
5. **Threat Mitigations** - How the pattern addresses specific threats
